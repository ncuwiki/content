## Appearance

Garth is an exceptionally large, muscular man. Known for his intimidating presence, he towers over most creatures of Elluryah, human or not.

He is almost always seen clad in his Royal Armor, which is designed to counter most magical attacks.

## Personality

Garth is a stoic, serious warrior with an unyielding loyalty to his kingdom. Above all he treasures maintaining peace and justice within the kingdom, to a sometimes questionable degree.

## Relationships

### [Wade](/wiki/Wade "Wade")

Garth is Wade's commander, ally, and friend. Garth fully trusts Wade to have his back in battles- both physical and political. Garth is protective of Wade, and vents his feelings only to him. Wade tries to see Garth’s perspective on things, and keep him in check emotionally when necessary.

### [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael")

Garth and Ghael do not have a personal relationship, but they certainly keep a close eye on one another. While he has an inherent dislike of witches and mages, Garth seems to hold some level of respect for Ghael the Witch, who helped save the kingdom in it's darkest hour.

Ghael's action directly saved the past king's son, an action for which Garth holds immense gratitude. The experience they shared pushing back the enemy that threatened their land resulted in a mutual understanding of sorts, so the two mostly try to avoid crossing paths. Garth allows Ghael and her students to live in the outskirts of the kingdom, even though any other known magic users would be persecuted. He does, however, state that he would not hesitate to crush them if they were to get in the way of his objective of justice.

Ghael is glad the Ellurian army is led by such a powerful figure, but doesn’t trust his judgment at all. Garth, similarly, understands the great power that Ghael wields, but feels that her agenda must be shady since she turned down the king’s offer to join his army.

### [The Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands")

Garth despises The Shifting Sands. He believes that to align oneself with a faction that brazenly ignores the king’s law is to spit in his face. He believes this goes beyond committing a simple crime, and deserves a punishment to match.

### [The Novis](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis")

Garth despises The Novis as well. He saved the current king of Elluryah (then the prince) from The Novis when the cult attacked the royal family twenty years ago. He witnessed their power and treachery firsthand, and made a lifelong vow to destroy anything associated with them.

### [Garth's Father](/wiki/Garth%27s_Father?action=edit&redlink=1 "Garth's Father (page does not exist)")

Garth’s father put an immense amount of pressure on his son. Anything less than an exemplary performance was considered failure. Garth was derided and beaten by his father, allegedly as part of his training. Garth carries many scars left by his father, only a few of them being physical.

### [Percival](/wiki/Percival?action=edit&redlink=1 "Percival (page does not exist)")

## Abilities and Powers

### Strength

Garth is immensely physically powerful, widely considered to be the strongest man in all of Elluryah. A frequently recited anecdote in Elluryah tells of a time he lifted a horse and its rider to prevent them from fleeing, and threw them onto the ground. His warhammer is said to weigh 100 pounds, yet he swings it with ease.

### Weapons

Garth's weapon of choice is a massive warhammer, weighing at about 100 pounds, which he wields almost effortlessly. His armor is nigh impenetrable, made from the rarest and strongest of metals, and custom fitted to his massive frame.

### Combat

Even beyond his physical abilities, Garth’s tremendous tenacity is enough to inspire his allies and intimidate his enemies. Garth’s position as the King’s Right Hand also lends him a very high degree of political power. Mobility and range are Garth’s shortcomings, but they are thoroughly covered by his second-in-command Wade.

## History

### Ch.1: [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")

In “ [The King’s Right Hand](/wiki/The_King%27s_Right_Hand "The King's Right Hand")” Garth takes custody of [Ulric](/wiki/Ulric "Ulric") from Kat, Astrid, and Grub. He and Wade lead him west through [Forsyth Forest](/wiki/Forsyth_Forest "Forsyth Forest"), back toward [Bristol](/wiki/Bristol "Bristol"). When Ulric notices that his shackles are damaged and attempts to flee, Garth uses the situation to justify smashing the prisoner with his hammer. Garth had intentionally chosen the damaged shackles.

### Ch.3 [Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

In “ [A Terrible Fate](/wiki/A_Terrible_Fate "A Terrible Fate")” it is revealed that [Sloan](/wiki/Sloan "Sloan") begged Garth to spare a few soldiers to face [Silver](/wiki/Silver "Silver"), but that Garth scoffed and shooed him away.

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “ [The Setting Obscene](/wiki/The_Setting_Obscene "The Setting Obscene")” Garth and Wade investigate a violent crime scene. Garth laments the state of affairs in [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"), focusing on the plethora of dangerous and unaligned figures.

In “ [Kat and Mouse](/wiki/Kat_and_Mouse "Kat and Mouse")” Garth shows up just as Kat, Astrid, Nora, and Shina’s fight is coming to its climax.

In “ [Mismatch/Impact](/wiki/Mismatch/Impact "Mismatch/Impact")” Garth takes control of the scene, forcing [Nora](/wiki/Nora "Nora") to try to flee. She blasts a barrage of icicle shards at Wade in the process, but he also fires an arrow into her thigh, which immobilizes her. This enrages Garth, who smashes her leg with his hammer. He raises it to finish her off, but [Wade](/wiki/Wade "Wade") tells him to stop. Garth threatens everyone else on the scene to stay out of his way.

### Ch.5: [Silver and White](/wiki/Silver_and_White "Silver and White")

In “The Mage” the titular mage informs Nick that Garth is aware of his presence in Bristol.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “ [Black as Thunder](/wiki/Black_as_Thunder "Black as Thunder")” Garth arrives at the Novis base as Kat, Astrid, and Grub finish off the dozen lesser cultists. “ [White Robe](/wiki/White_Robe "White Robe")” shows himself, and invites the intruders to attack. Garth promptly accepts, but White Robe gingerly catches a full swing of his hammer. Garth manages to surprise his opponent and break several ribs with his sole clean strike of the encounter. White Robe then unveils his “big boy attack,” in which he launches an unseen blast of energy at Garth from twenty feet away, which knocks the soldier unconscious.

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")

## Trivia

- Garth's Hammer is stated to weigh 100 pounds.

- Garth's Royal Armor is incredibly resistant to magical attacks, but it is not immune. A sufficiently strong magic attack can pierce its defenses and hurt Garth. Not to mention there are certain ways to bypass its defenses, such as an attack that does not directly strike with magic (i.e. stormwinds summoned through magic can still push him back)
