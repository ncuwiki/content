## Geography\[ [edit](/wiki/Elluryah?action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Geography") \| [hide](/wiki/Elluryah "Expand or collapse this section") \| [hide all](/wiki/Elluryah "Expand or collapse all sections on this page")\]

Elluryah is surrounded by sea on all but its eastern side, where a mighty river separates it from the neighboring kingdom. The continent is broken up into five regions: Central Elluryah, The Mistral Mountains to the north, Forsyth Forest to the east, The Kharusurahk Desert to the south, and The Wailing Coast to the west. Each of these regions features one primary town, with other dwellings scarcely dotting the map.

## Demographics\[ [edit](/wiki/Elluryah?action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Demographics") \| [hide](/wiki/Elluryah "Expand or collapse this section")\]

Elluryah trades with other kingdoms via The Wailing Coast, but is self-sufficient when it comes to essentials. The kingdom is ruled by a royal family, who live in a castle at the heart of Bristol- the capital city in Central Elluryah. A royal army, lead by [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth") and his second-in-command Wade, protects the kingdom from threats, along with numerous nonaligned fighters.
