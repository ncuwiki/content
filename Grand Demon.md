Due to the danger imposed by Grand Demons, and the great reward of slaying one, they have mostly been hunted to extinction by powerful fighters. Grand Demon [Silver](/wiki/Silver "Silver") of [Forsyth Forest](/wiki/Forsyth_Forest "Forsyth Forest") is the last one in [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"). He has survived due to the nature of his curse; anyone who encounters him will die in seven days, regardless of where they go or whether Silver is even still alive.
