## Trivia

- Musically, the album is a moody, post-rock take on the Nintendocore sound.

- The album art was created by [WWG](/wiki/Weekly_Words_and_Grammar "Weekly Words and Grammar") himself.

- “ [Leylines II](/wiki/Leylines_II "Leylines II")” appears on this album, despite a first Leylines track not yet being present in the NCU. In fact, parts 3 and 4 were also released before the first. This is due to the events not being revealed to the audience in chronological order.

- Twenty Years of Snow is the only NCU chapter written from a first person perspective.
