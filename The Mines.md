## History

The mines below [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet") were once a source of great wealth, containing rare metals and gems.

However, a powerful and mysterious object, dubbed [the Nexis](/wiki/The_Nexis "The Nexis"), was found deep in the mines, and a cult called [The Novis](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis") soon formed around it. An attack was launched by The Novis in a bid for control of the kingdom, and many Elluryans were killed. Witch [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael"), mage [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim"), and dragonborn [Atlas](/wiki/Atlas "Atlas") pushed the cult leader back to the Nexis, and collapsed the mines.

After the fall of the Novis, [the Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands") rose up in the vacuum of power in Eredet. Soldiers were sent in to deal with them, but were outplayed in the confusing [Kharusurahk Desert](/wiki/Kharusurahk_Desert "Kharusurahk Desert"). High-ranking soldier [Locke](/wiki/Locke "Locke") later led a successful assault, driving the gang away from the town. Locke became the mayor of Eredet, and shortly thereafter reopened the mines in an attempt to get the town back on its feet. Despite great efforts- overworking of the miners in fact- the mines haven't been very productive in recent years.
