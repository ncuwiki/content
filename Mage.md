# Mage

A mage is an arcane manipulator - one who studies the laws of nature and the mind, and learns how to bend them to create otherwise impossible outcomes.

## Description

Practiced mages can detect and flow with the leylines of the land, and redirect the energy they contain. Mages often keep their personal findings in tomes, constantly compounding their understanding and capabilities.

Very rarely, a person is born with an inherent ability to affect a specific natural law. These people are not mages, although their gifts allow them to tap into the same energy. [[Sloan]], for example, was born with the ability to temporarily freeze targets in time. The Kingâ€™s Right Hand who preceded [[Garth]] was also born with a natural arcane gift.
