## Geography

Boraea is a fairly isolated Elluryan town, due to it being situated deep in the snowy Mistral Mountains north of Bristol. The climate is usually snowy, which further contributes to the isolated feeling of Boraea compared to other towns. The journey to Boraea is somewhat challenging, as even the main roads can become hazardous due to the weather conditions from time to time.

## Demographics

The architecture of Boraea is considered the finest in the kingdom, which partially explains the higher-than-average population of artists, philosophers, and scholars in the town.

[Nick](/wiki/Nick "Nick") lives and studies in his sanctuary in Boraea. Witches [Shina](/wiki/Shina "Shina") and [Nora](/wiki/Nora "Nora") also call the town home.

## History
