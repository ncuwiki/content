The Novis were based in the mines below [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet"), where they had formed around [The Nexis](/wiki/The_Nexis "The Nexis"). Unnatural powers were bestowed upon the cultists, who had used The Nexis to open a portal to another world. Witch [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael"), Great Mage [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim"), and dragonborn warrior [Atlas](/wiki/Atlas "Atlas") were prominent in defeating The Novis, having driven them back to The Nexis and collapsed the mines around it.

The king’s royal army dealt with many cultists during the attack. [Percival](/wiki/Percival?action=edit&redlink=1 "Percival (page does not exist)"), the King’s Right Hand at the time, was unable to save the king, but young warrior [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth") did manage to save the prince. Many members of the cult survived, scrambling into the shadows. Without The Nexis, however, their powers faded away.

The Novis is mentioned directly for the first time, though not by name. Ghael, Ghenim, and Grub are discussing recent events, and compare them to the cult’s activity from twenty years ago. [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth") and [Wade](/wiki/Wade "Wade") also investigate a Novis base that has been brutally attacked by an unknown, blade-wielding force.

### Ch.5: [Silver and White](/wiki/Silver_and_White "Silver and White")\[ [edit](/wiki/The_Novis?action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ch.5:  Silver and White") \| [hide](/wiki/The_Novis "Expand or collapse this section")\]

[Nick](/wiki/Nick "Nick") senses the Nexis, and believes the Novis have returned. In [Bristol](/wiki/Bristol "Bristol") he is accosted by a cultist, who reveals that the Novis has an army almost ready, a prodigal young mage, and [The Black Tome](/wiki/The_Black_Tome?action=edit&redlink=1 "The Black Tome (page does not exist)") in hand. He offers to grant great power to Nick if he will join the Novis again. Nick refuses, and the two mages battle.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")\[ [edit](/wiki/The_Novis?action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ch.6: The Storm") \| [hide](/wiki/The_Novis "Expand or collapse this section")\]

[Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael") tells [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid") she’s afraid The Novis are indeed resurfacing. She speculates that [Nora](/wiki/Nora "Nora") and [Shina](/wiki/Shina "Shina") are pawns of the cult, and that the cult is also responsible for the theft of [The Black Tome](/wiki/The_Black_Tome?action=edit&redlink=1 "The Black Tome (page does not exist)") from the library archive. She reveals that [Riza](/wiki/Riza "Riza") has found the cult’s base of operations in Bristol, and that the girls and [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub") are to intervene that same day. She also confirms that [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth") and [Wade](/wiki/Wade "Wade") will soon head to [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet") to check [the Nexis](/wiki/The_Nexis "The Nexis") in the mines.

Kat, Astrid, Grub, and Garth fight “ [White Robe](/wiki/White_Robe "White Robe"),” the leader of the Novis’ branch in Bristol, and a dozen of his powerful servants. By the end of the fight both Garth and Grub are knocked out, and Kat has effectively shut down. However, the Novis members are just barely defeated in the end. Upon hearing the details, Ghael brings Grub along to visit [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim"), where they confirm that the Novis has returned.

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")\[ [edit](/wiki/The_Novis?action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Ch.7: Something Fierce") \| [hide](/wiki/The_Novis "Expand or collapse this section")\]

A public address is held to share information on recent happenings with the people of [Bristol](/wiki/Bristol "Bristol"). Garth and Wade assure them that in the unlikely event that the Novis returns, they are equipped to handle the cult. [Riza](/wiki/Riza "Riza") brings up White Robe defeating Garth, which lets the people know that they should in fact be taking this threat seriously. Later that day Garth, Wade and a small fleet of soldiers trek through the [Kharusurahk Desert](/wiki/Kharusurahk_Desert "Kharusurahk Desert") toward [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet"), where they will ultimately investigate the former home of the Nexis - the mines.
