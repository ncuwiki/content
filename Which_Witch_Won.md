| _Sparks fly, flames erupt_<br>Sands stream and sting in sudden gales<br>Dazed and displaced by torrents abrupt<br>As two witches clash to see who will prevail<br>Kat, 14, a prodigy- noble, but a bit naive<br>Astrid, 16, gives it her best- no moment is spared for rest<br>Light radiates from within balled fists<br>The gems that bring their powers to exist<br>All five elements, nature's full force<br>Through these girls such powers course<br>A grin extends Kat's face, bright as the crescent moon<br>Astrid more zeroed in, her movements well attuned<br>Their gemstones' energies nearly fully consumed<br>Something has got to give, the scale must tip soon<br>Lightning explodes from Astrid's hand<br>Rampant, lethal, charges no man could withstand<br>But Kat has her own electric stone<br>Neutralizes the bolts as they are thrown- skill well honed<br>Kat blasts gusts robust to render her foe prone<br>And pin her down with gravel summoned from her earth stone<br>Fireballs soar through the air, roar toward their target square<br>A sudden surge of water leaves nothing there<br>Once-precious stones cast aside as they go grey<br>Lest they be grabbed by mistake and thus betray<br>Like night and day they trade..<br>"That's enough- well done, girls"<br>Ghael calls off the friendly feud<br>"Hey, I've got money riding on this!"<br>Grub jokes and adds "how rude!"<br>"Awesome as always" Kat says<br>Astrid agrees, "I nearly had you too!"<br>Ghael says "I'm quite impressed<br>Now quickly rest, you've more yet to do" |
