## Description\[ [edit](/wiki/Kobold?action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description") \| [hide](/wiki/Kobold "Expand or collapse this section") \| [hide all](/wiki/Kobold "Expand or collapse all sections on this page")\]

Kobolds stand around 3-4’ tall, and are normally 40-60 pounds. They are cold-blooded, and have tails that can be dropped and regrown.

Kobolds sporadically produce and heave up elemental gems, which they often then sell at a high price. This allows many kobolds to lead lavish and often sleazy lives. Due to this, and their strange appearances when compared to other civilized races, kobolds are not typically held in very high regard in the public eye.

• The names of  kobolds that appear in the NCU all reference insects. The names [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub"), [Larv](/wiki/Larv "Larv"), and [Nymph](/wiki/Nymph?action=edit&redlink=1 "Nymph (page does not exist)") (mentioned in Kat’s diary) reference grubs, larvae, and nymphs. All three are words that describe the premature stages of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis. [Atlas](/wiki/Atlas "Atlas") is a reference to the atlas beetle.
