## History

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “Til Stigmas Cease” Ghael tells Kat, Grub, and Astrid of a witch that has travelled to Bristol from Boraea to cause trouble. Ghael is referring to Nora, as she doesn’t yet know that Nora has an apprentice.

In “Steadfast Outcast” Shina makes her first appearance as she arrives at her and Nora’s hideout. The two square up for a fight with Kat and Astrid.

In “Chill for a Spell” Shina fights Kat. Kat has the upper hand until Shina drops an elemental gem she’s using. Kat pauses and tells her to pick up the stone, if she insists on fighting. Shina takes advantage of Kat’s kindness and gets the drop on her, pinning her under a flurry of snow. Nora, who can cast without an elemental gem, says that Shina will soon obtain this power as well. The two attempt to tempt Kat and Astrid with the same power before exiting.

In “Kat and Mouse” the four witches meet for a rematch. The fight is relatively brief, as Kat pleads with the others to try to avoid violence altogether. She gets through to Shina, who drops her elemental gem. Astrid quickly blindsides Shina, however, knocking her out just before Garth arrives and the rest of the fight plays out.

Shina isn’t mentioned again in Arcana Profane, but it can be inferred that she and Nora are sent to the dungeon to serve out sentences for their crimes.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “The Calm Before” Ghael reveals that Nora and Shina had been hired as a distraction to her and the rest of Bristol. Their actions damaged public opinion of witches, as intended.
