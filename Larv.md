# Larv

Larv is a kobold laborer and blacksmith who lives in Shinrin.

In [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem") Larv finds himself clashing with another blacksmith named Ulric, as well as a group of bandits called the Shifting Sands. In the midst of the conflict, he claims to have produced a light gem, which is the fabled sixth type of elemental gem. This prompts [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat"), [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid"), and [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub") to head to Shinrin to investigate.

### [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")

Larv is first mentioned, albeit not by name, in “ [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem").” [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael") tells [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid") that a kobold in Shinrin claims to have bore a light gem.

In “Discord Explored” Ulric alleges that Larv is attempting to tarnish his reputation out of jealousy. Larv protests that Ulric is in fact the liar, and accuses him of selling weapons to the Shifting Sands gang. Larv invites [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat"), [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid"), and [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub") to see his light gem, and they bring Ulric along. In “The Sandstorm Sudden” members of the Shifting Sands gang show up and announce their intention to kill Larv. Kat, Astrid, and Ulric fight them off while Grub and Larv hide away. In “A Confounding Find” Larv says the Shifting Sands have come looking for him before, which Ulric disputes before departing. Grub and the witches decide to stay with Larv to protect him. That night Astrid sneaks into his spare room and finds a stash of Shifting Sand weapons. She also debunks his light gem as a hoax. In “Rematch / Dispatch” Kat, Astrid, and Grub head back to Ulric’s forge, where they discover the truth: Ulric has been selling weapons to the Shifting Sands. When Larv caught wind of what he was up to, Ulric told the gang they’d have to eliminate the kobold to continue their dealings. Fortunately, Grub and the witches were present when the mercenaries showed up to kill Larv. Thinking on his feet, Ulric had fought against the bandits to keep up his facade.

In “Ghael the Grey” Kat reveals that Larv had come clean about forging the stone. He knew he was in over his head, so he had to get attention however he could. If he was believed to be “pure of heart” in the process, that would only aid his noble cause- despite his ignoble means.
