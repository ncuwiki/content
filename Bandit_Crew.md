## Appearance

They are comprised of two [ex-Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands") with red hand marks stamped on their faces, two down-on-their-luck cousins from [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet"), and a young [kobold](/wiki/Kobold "Kobold") hoping to impress a new love interest.

The two cousins have a caramel complexion and black hair. They wear simple, ragged clothing. The two scimitar-wielding [ex-Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands") wear bandanas concealing the lower halves of their faces and have red hand marks stamped over their eyes and foreheads. The young kobold has green skin and wears simple leather armor.

## Personality

## Relationships

It is briefly mentioned that the cousins’ grandfather is in some sort of trouble, which is why they are participating. The kobold has apparently joined the bandit crew in hopes of impressing his love interest.

## Abilities and Powers

The bandit crew relies on strength in numbers, and ambushing unsuspecting victims. The two more experienced members own a creature called an armadrake, whose cry can paralyze foes. They don enchanted bands that protect them from its shrill cry.

## History

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")

In “Opportunity Makes Amends” the crew hides in old ruins and chats while waiting for targets to approach. The cousins try to dissuade the kobold from participating, but he chooses to remain. The ex-Shifting Sands mention having a plan B, should things go south.

In “Ransack / Payback” Garth, Wade, and their troops unknowingly walk into the bandit crew’s trap. Upon seeing the soldiers, the cousins and kobold wish to flee, but before they can one of the ex-Shifting Sands pinches an armadrake, which screams and paralyzes all present. The more experienced bandits are immune to the cries thanks to enchanted bands, and so they begin collecting the belongings of the soldiers. Garth manages to fall forward onto and crush the armadrake. Wade tries to apprehend the bandits, but Garth immediately begins to slaughter them instead. Wade attempts to help the kobold escape, but Garth manages to crush him too by tossing his hammer. Within a matter of moments, only one of the bandits is left alive. Wade talks Garth into sending the survivor- one of the two cousins- back to the dungeon.
