The town of Shinrin lies in the forest, and exports much of the kingdom's wood, fruits, and other natural resources. A mighty river to the east of Shinrin separates Elluryah from the neighboring kingdom.

## Demographics

The town of [Shinrin](/wiki/Shinrin "Shinrin") makes up the majority population of Forsyth Forest.

The Grand Demon Silver also lurks about his territory, and dwells in a dark cave deep in Forsyth Forest. The general population of Ellyruah knows to steer clear of Silver's territory, including the residents of Shinrin. A mysterious white raven has also been spotted flying over the forest on multiple occasions.
