# Locke

Lock is the mayor or [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet"). He was a rather skilled soldier in the royal army before rising to his current political rank. After the cult event and the rise of [The Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sand?action=edit&redlink=1 "The Shifting Sand (page does not exist)") left Eredet in shambles, Locke led a mission to drive the bandits away and reopen the mines. The town was impressed and thankful, and elected Locke to remain as their mayor.

Locke led a largely successful campaign to drive the desert bandits away from Eredet after they had all but taken over. The Shiftings Sands hold quite a grudge against him, but lack the manpower to do much about it. Rather, they mostly opt to find their victims in other towns in current times.
