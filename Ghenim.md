# Ghenim

Ghenim, the Great Mage, was once the most powerful mage in all of Elluryah. Twenty years ago he, along with Ghael and Atlas were largely responsible for defeating a great force that threatened to take over the land. The final encounter permanently cost him the majority of his arcane power, leaving him mostly as a seer. He is held in high regard by nearly all who know him, including the king.

## History

### [Ch.3 Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

In “Aces and the Joker” Isaac and Sloan venture to Ghenim’s home for a reading, but are intercepted by Shifting Sands on the way. In “Star Matrix View” it is revealed that Ghenim’s power was drained by a single, immense spell years ago. He can still cast minor spells, and he maintains his prophetic vision. He uses his remaining skills to aid Isaac. In “Darkness on the Horizon” Isaac reveals several details from Ghenim’s reading of Sloan. Ghenim also told Isaac that killing Silver will not remove the Grand Demon’s curse from Sloan or Ellie. Finally, Ghenim cast a protection spell on Isaac to protect him from the same curse.

In “Star Matrix View II” Ghenim watches Isaac and Sloan remotely, and focuses on his belief that Isaac can win. Due to the nature of Silver’s power, this actually helps tip the scale in Isaac’s favor.

### [Ch. 4 Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “At Sixes and Sevens” Ghael and Grub head to Ghenim’s home to discuss the state of things. In “Peril Impending” it is revealed that Ghael and Ghenim were instrumental in defeating The Novis twenty years ago. The two, along with Grub, consider that the cult may be on the rise again. They discuss Garth, their pasts, and how to proceed.

### [Ch. 6 The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “The Calm Before” Ghael notes that even Ghenim could not decipher The Black Tome. It is reemphasized that Ghenim, Ghael, and Atlas defeated The Novis twenty years ago, but that the cult may be resurfacing. Finally, it is noted that Ghenim has succeeded in convincing the king to send Garth to Eredet to check The Nexis in the mines.

In “A Glimmer in the Gloom” Ghenim is again visited by Ghael and Grub, who warn that The Novis are surely back. The fact that Ghenim’s power was lost in the fight twenty years ago is brought up again as well.
