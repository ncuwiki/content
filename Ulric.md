### [Larv](/wiki/Larv "Larv")

Ulric and Larv have a somewhat contentious relationship. They were fledgling blacksmiths at about the same time, but Ulric had a natural skill for it that Larv lacked. Shinrin had no need for two smiths, so Larv moved on to other labor. Ulric’s prodding left some bad blood between the two.

### \[The Shifting Sands\]

Ulric secretly supplies The Shifting Sands with quality weapons at a fair price. Ulric’s resources are free to him, since he supplies the royal army with much of their weaponry. This allows him to sell to the bandits at a low price, while still netting a hefty profit. He does not, however, feel any allegiance to the desert faction.

## History

In “Discord Explored” Kat, Astrid, and Grub arrive in Shinrin and track Ulric down. He tells them that Larv, a local kobold laborer, has been spreading rumors about him. Ulric says Larv used to be Shinrin’s blacksmith, but Ulric put him out of work with his superior skill. Ulric says this is why Larv has been telling townsfolk that Ulric is selling weapons to the Shifting Sands gang. In “The Sandstorm Sudden” Ulric helps Kat and Astrid fight off Shifting Sands who invade Larv’s home. He tells them to drop their weapons and retreat, which they do after a beating. He says there’s no need to pursue or capture them; they know better than to return now. In “A Confounding Find” Ulric doubts that Larv was the target of the attack, noting that he would be dead by now if they wanted him to be. He then leaves to take care of a shipment. Kat, Astrid, and Grub decide to visit Ulric the following morning, after Astrid finds evidence of Larv being the corrupt one.

In “Rematch / Dispatch” Kat, Astrid, and Grub find Ulric at his home, arguing with Shifting Sands. It is revealed that he asked them to kill Larv, but since they attacked while witnesses were present, he had to fight them off to protect his name. The witches and Grub decide to swing into action, defeating and apprehending everyone present. In “The King’s Right Hand” Ulric is handed over to Garth and Wade, as onlookers watch in the middle of Shinrin. The soldiers escort the fugitive back to Bristol. Along the way Ulric notices that his shackles are damaged, and that he can likely break free. He does so and attempts to flee, but Wade fires an arrow into his thigh. Garth essentially tells Ulric that traitors don’t deserve to live, and then crushes him with his hammer.

In “Ghael the Grey” Kat naively says that Ulric is in the dungeon by now, and she knows he’ll change his ways and restore his reputation eventually.
