### [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael")

Phoebe and Ghael are friends and allies. Phoebe will take custody of abandoned witches that are brought to or found by Ghael, and even trains them in the basics of spellcasting. Ghael spent quite a bit of time working with Phoebe in the past to help her understand witches- not just the magic aspect, but the emotions that come along with it. Ghael wishes she had had someone like Phoebe in her life when she was young.

### [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid")

Phoebe was both Kat and Astrid’s first mother figure, having raised the witches from infancy, before being adopted by [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael"). Phoebe cared for and protected the girls for years, as she does all of her adopted children. Kat visits Phoebe and the young witches as frequently as she can. Phoebe is much more emotionally supportive for Kat than Ghael, although she can’t truly empathize. Astrid visits Phoebe occasionally, always leaving with a smile

### [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth")

Phoebe sees Garth as an instigator and even an embodiment of Elluryah’s misunderstanding and hatred of witches. Garth is aware of who Phoebe is, and she has noticed the disgust in his eyes when he’s seen her in the past.

### Kobolds

Several kind kobolds, including Larv of Shinrin, donate their elemental gems to Phoebe so that she can teach the children about their powers.

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “Til Stigmas Cease” Ghael says that Phoebe still takes in new witch orphans each year, illustrating Elluryah’s negative emotions towards witches.

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")

In “Plight of the Knights” Phoebe is intimidated by Garth and other enraged Bristolites, but is promptly defended by Riza.
