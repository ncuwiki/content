## Appearance

Ghael is an older woman of average height and slender build

## Personality

Ghael is a serious and stubborn woman, having witnesses firsthand the mistreatment of witches by the general population.

## Relationships

### [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid")

Ghael is Kat and Astrid’s trainer, and something of a mother to them. Ghael strenuously trains both girls to inherit her mantle of “strongest witch in the kingdom.” She provides a safe home and routine for the girls. She is very protective of them, but seldom provides much in the way of emotional support for them. The girls wish for a closer relationship with Ghael, but she often seems too preoccupied. Ghael and Astrid’s moral compasses are closely aligned, meaning sometimes they keep things from Kat.

### [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub")

Ghael and Grub are allies in protecting Elluryah. Their friendship goes back many years, even though to an outsider it may seem that Grub is a noussance to Ghael. He helps her with everything from chores around the house, to taking care of Kat and Astrid, to debating with Ghenim about the fate of the kingdom. Ghael trusts Grub fully, despite his goofy nature.

### [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim")

Ghael and Ghenim are allies in protecting [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"). Twenty years ago they fought together in the mines of [Eredet](/wiki/Eredet "Eredet") to drive out the Novis. They swore to remain the protectors of the kingdom for the rest of their lives, and still regularly meet to discuss the state of things.

### [Riza](/wiki/Riza "Riza")

Ghael and Riza are allies in protecting Elluryah. Riza patrols [Bristol’s](/wiki/Bristol "Bristol") dark streets and reports big threats back to Ghael. While their relationship is mostly professional, they share dinner on occasion, and Riza often has Kat and Astrid over.

### [Phoebe](/wiki/Phoebe "Phoebe")

Ghael and Phoebe are friends and allies. Phoebe will take custody of abandoned witches that are brought to or found by Ghael, and even trains them in the basics of spellcasting. Ghael spent quite a bit of time working with Phoebe in the past to help her understand witches - not just the magic aspect, but the emotions that come along with it. Ghael wishes she had had someone like Phoebe in her life when she was young.

### [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth")

Ghael and Garth do not have a personal relationship, but they certainly keep a close eye on one another. Ghael is glad the Ellurian army is led by such a powerful figure, but doesn’t trust his judgment at all. Garth, similarly, understands the great power that Ghael wields, but feels that her agenda must be shady since she turned down the king’s offer to join his army.

### [The Novis](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis")

Ghael is obsessively determined to snuff out any remaining branches of The Novis. She sends Kat, Astrid, and Grub on missions to battle with the cult and gain information. She and Grub also meet with Gheim to discuss the state of things and make plans to move forward.

### [Atlas](/wiki/Atlas "Atlas")

Ghael and Atlas were friends and allies leading up to the final battle with The Novis twenty years ago. Though Atlas perished due to wounds he took in the battle, she and Ghenim still fight to make sure his sacrifice wasn’t in vain.

## Abilities and Powers

### Magic

Like all [witches](/wiki/Witch "Witch"), Ghael can pull the energy out of elemental gems and use it to defend against that element, or to unleash offensive spells. Ghael is known to be one of the most powerful magic users in all the land, considered by many to be the most powerful witch alive. After decades of focused training she’s built up her elemental tolerance to the point that she can fully pull the energy from three unused stones in an instant, and unleash an obscenely powerful spell. Even past her prime, she is still capable of this feat that most witches would collapse from attempting. She has extensive knowledge of all manner of spells and incantations.

Ghael is up there in years, however, and while her magical abilities remain, her physical abilities are diminished.

### Magic Knowledge

Having studied magic her entire life, Ghael has gathered all sorts of knowledge of various types of magic, both mundane and offensive.

### Combat

Ghael's feared reputation is well earned, it is stated that if she tried, Ghael could even defeat the [grand demon](/wiki/Grand_demon?action=edit&redlink=1 "Grand demon (page does not exist)") [Silver](/wiki/Silver "Silver"), a feat many people have failed and died in the process.

The people of the kingdom speak of her with a sense of fear and caution. Even the Shifting Sand, a gang of criminals and thieves ran away at the sight of her.

## History

### Ch.1: [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")

In “Which Witch Won?” Ghael supervises [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid")’s sparring session, which she ultimately ends to brief the girls on a mission.

In “ [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")” Ghael recounts the titular legend, and then instructs the girls and Grub to head to [Shinrin](/wiki/Shinrin "Shinrin") to investigate rumors of a light gem being created there.

In “ [Ghael the Grey](/wiki/Ghael_the_Grey "Ghael the Grey")” Kat, Astrid, and Grub recap the events from Shinrin to Ghael. A couple Shifting Sands begin banging on the door, having trailed the trio. Ghael kicks the door open and scares them away by simply dropping her name.

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “ [Which Witch Two](/wiki/Which_Witch_Two "Which Witch Two")” Ghael again supervises Kat and Astrid’s sparring session, and then lets them know she has a mission for them.

In “ [Til Stigmas Cease](/wiki/Til_Stigmas_Cease "Til Stigmas Cease")” Ghael laments public opinion of witches in [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"), while telling the girls of a witch from [Boraea](/wiki/Boraea "Boraea") who has come to Bristol to cause trouble. The girls and Grub are tasked with stopping her.

In “ [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane_(Song) "Arcana Profane (Song)")” Ghael learns of Kat and Astrid’s fight with Nora and Shina. She is skeptical of Nora’s alleged power, but nonetheless keeps the girls focused on training hard until Riza can track the rogue witches down again.

In “ [At Sixes and Sevens](/wiki/At_Sixes_and_Sevens "At Sixes and Sevens")” Ghael is furious that Kat and Astrid didn’t better control the situation with [Nora](/wiki/Nora "Nora") and [Shina](/wiki/Shina "Shina"). She scolds them, and then leaves to meet with [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim"), instructing Grub to come along. He tells her to show a bit of sympathy, but she isn’t receptive.

In “ [Peril Impending](/wiki/Peril_Impending "Peril Impending")” it is revealed that Ghael and Ghenim were instrumental in defeating The Novis twenty years ago. The two, along with Grub, consider that the cult may be on the rise again. They discuss [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth"), their pasts, and how to proceed.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “ [The Calm Before](/wiki/The_Calm_Before "The Calm Before")” Ghael tasks Kat, Astrid, and Grub with ambushing a cult base that is likely the Novis. Her grave tone paints the severity of the mission.

In “-What Kat Dragged In” Kat recalls meeting Grub, Astrid, and Ghael for the first time. She fondly remembers the early days of their relationships, and laments the fractures that exist now.

In “ [A Glimmer in the Gloom](/wiki/A_Glimmer_in_the_Gloom "A Glimmer in the Gloom")” Ghael and Grub meet with Ghenim to warn him that the Novis have in fact returned.

## Trivia

- Ghael's theme color is Gray.

- Upon closer inspection, it seems that during her prime, her "colors" were closer to Kat's Purple, and this merely desaturated over time, resulting in the gray we see now.
