# The Shifting Sands

The Shifting Sands are a bandit gang based in the Kharusurahk Desert. They came to prominence in the years after the cult attack. The town of Eredet was still vulnerable, so they were able to work their way into controlling the territory. The king sent a soldier named Locke and a fleet of troops to regain control. The Shifting Sands were overthrown and run off, winning Locke the respect of Eredet and the king.

Since their defeat, the Shifting Sands operate out of numerous small settlements in the desert. Many members travel into Bristol, Letchim, and even Shinrin to earn money in illicit ways. Eredet is still in shambles, and thus doesn't have much to offer. There are rumors that the leader of the Shifting Sands is a hyenafolk warrior.

## Description

## History

### Ch.1: [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")

The track "Discord Explored" from chapter one first introduces the gang, although not yet by name. Larv accuses Ulric of selling weapons to the gang. Then at the end of the track, a troop of Shifting Sands shows up.

In "The Sandstorm Sudden" a fight breaks out between Kat, Astrid, Ulric, and a troop of Shifting Sands. Grub and Larv hide nearby for the most part. The gang eventually drops their weapons and retreats, defeated. Ulric calls them "desert dogs," which is a common way of putting them down.

In "A Confounding Find" Larv accuses the Shifting Sand of causing trouble around Shinrin in the past weeks, including threats to his life. That night Astrid sneaks into a spare room in Larv's house and finds a large stash of what appear to be Shifting Sands weapons.

In "Rematch / Dispatch" Kat, Astrid, and Grub find Ulrich in a confrontation with Shifting Sands. It turns out he is supplying them with weapons, as Larv said. He fought against them merely to keep up appearances. His relationship with them is clearly rocky. The witches and Grub defeat Ulrich and the bandits, and then turn them over to authorities.

Finally, in "Ghael the Grey" two Shifting Sands appear at Ghael's home, having tailed Kat, Astrid, and Grub after the events in Shinrin. Ghael threatens the men, and upon learning who she is they promptly apologize and flee.

### Ch.3: [Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

Members of the gang can be seen using a burrowing desert creature called an armadrake in the track "Aces and the Joker" from chapter three. When agitated, the creature emits a scream that causes paralysis, fainting, seizures, and even death in some cases. The bandits had spells cast on them to protect them from the effects. Isaac threatened the thieves, but ultimately Sloan handled the situation with his power.

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")

## Trivia

- The name Shifting Sands is a reference to Shifting Sand Land, which is the eighth course in Super Mario 64.
