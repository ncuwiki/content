Eredet is the smallest and poorest town of Elluryah, thanks to the cult event that was based there a couple decades ago, and the brief reign of the Shifting Sands gang afterward.

## Geography

Eredet is situated in the Kharusurahk Desert, to the south of the capital city of Bristol. The town was once booming thanks to the mines it was built around, but they seem to yield little since the tragic events that took place.

## Demographics

Eredet is considered the poorest town in [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"). After the events perpetrated by [an evil cult](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis"), the town was left almost barren, as most of the population fled the town in fear. Decades later, the town remains as a shell of its former self, mostly populated by families too poor to move elsewhere. Due to this, a group of bandits known as [The Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands") settled into the area and made it their territory.

[Jase](/wiki/Jase?action=edit&redlink=1 "Jase (page does not exist)") and his parents live and toil away in the mines of Eredet. [Arden](/wiki/Arden?action=edit&redlink=1 "Arden (page does not exist)") is stationed in the mines to keep an eye on things. [Locke](/wiki/Locke "Locke") was appointed mayor after driving [the Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands") away, and now leads operations in the mines with his right-hand-man, [Roth](/wiki/Roth?action=edit&redlink=1 "Roth (page does not exist)"). [Kaegan](/wiki/Kaegan?action=edit&redlink=1 "Kaegan (page does not exist)") the mage also lives deep in the mines, unbeknownst to most.
