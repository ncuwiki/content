## Appearance

Silver is a large, somewhat slender demon. He has a very rough jet-black skin that can resist most blade attacks and has a higher resistance to elemental magic. He has a relatively long tail that possesses as much, if not more strength than his other limbs. He has a multitude of large sharp teeth and claws, all of which are comparable to steel.

A large white mane covers his entire back, from his head to his tail. Coupled with his already resistant skin, this makes his back his strongest defense. The irises of his eyes are a glowing white, which are barely noticeable from the sclera, resulting in an unsettling full white color in his eyes.

Silver can move in both a bipedal and quadrupedal stance. When on all fours, he stands roughly at eye level with most humans . When using a bipedal stance, however, Silver stands at twice that size, standing taller than [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth").

## Personality

Silver is considered an especially malignant foe, even when compared to past Grand Demons. He feeds on the negative emotions felt by his victims, regardless of their location, making his presence a looming threat even beyond [Forsyth Forest](/wiki/Forsyth_Forest "Forsyth Forest").

### Curse

Silver survived long past the demise of other Grand Demons due to the nature of his curse. Anyone who encounters him will die in seven days, regardless of where they go or whether Silver is even still alive.

Due to his curse, any warrior who manages to face and slay Silver will still end up dead without powerful protection magic. Other than posessing a [Grand Soul](/wiki/Grand_Soul?action=edit&redlink=1 "Grand Soul (page does not exist)"), there is no way to survive the curse once it is received. This is why he is Elluryah’s last living Grand Demon.

### Physical Strength

If attacked, Silver is also a powerful and brutal fighter, especially against anyone who is afraid of or angry at him. His large sharp teeth and claws can easily cut through most armor plates.

## History

### Ch.1: [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")

In “Silver the Sinister” Grub tells Kat and Astrid about Silver as a scary story by light of campfire. The trio are camping in Forsyth Forest at this time, making the threat all too real. Grub knows, however, a path that avoids Silver’s territory.

### Ch.3: [Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

In “A Terrible Fate” Sloan tells mercenary Isaac that he and his daughter got lost in Forsyth Forest and were subsequently cursed by Silver. Isaac agrees to slay Silver.

In “Darkness on the Horizon” it is revealed that Isaac has received protection magic from Ghenim that renders him immune to Silver’s curse. It is also mentioned that Sloan and Ellie will not be rid of Silver’s curse, even if the demon is slain.

In “Vital Spirit” Isaac and Sloan have moments where the dread of their mission sinks in, but they speak of fond memories to distract themselves, and thus deprive Silver of negativity.

In “Star Matrix View II” Ghenim focuses on believing that Isaac will succeed in slaying Siver, which itself helps to weaken the demon.

In “Forest Folly” Isaac and Silver finally meet face to face. They trade threats before the fight begins. They seem evenly matched for a while, but Silver lands a powerful blow that knocks Isaac down and turns the tides. Silver considers waiting for Isaac’s protection spell to end, and then cursing him. Isaac calms himself, and focuses on the good that slaying Silver will do. As his fear and anger diminish, the fight changes course. Isaac manages to slice through one of Silver’s arms, dismembering him. Isaac steps in to swing the final blow, but finds himself frozen by Sloan’s magic. When he’s released, Silver is already dead.

In “I Feel Asleep” it is revealed that Ellie landed the final blow on Silver, while frozen by her father’s magic and lifted in his hands. This resulted in Silver’s Grand Soul transferring to Ellie.

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “The Setting Obscene” Garth mentions to Wade that no one knows who killed Silver, while ranting about powerful, unaligned fighters in Elluryah.
