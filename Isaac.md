# Isaac

Isaac is a grizzled mercenary based out of Bristol. A moral and courageous man, despite his often violent career choice, he will only accept jobs which he believes are for a just cause. Due to his profession, Isaac eventually came to know the Great Mage Ghenim, whom he occasionally visits when in need of information.

## Appearance

Isaac is a muscular 40-something year old man, covered in multiple scars from his countless battles with beasts and scoundrels. He has dark skin and a perpetual 5-o-clock shadow facial hair. He wears a partial plate armor under a large black cloak.

## Personality

## Relationships

### [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim")

Isaac and Ghenim are longtime allies, recurring to each other in times of need. Ghenim will often hire Isaac for jobs that require physical strength and prowess. Meanwhile Isaac will ask Ghenim for help with jobs that relate to magic. Their decades of working together have brought them a deep mutual respect and trust. Ghenim is the closest thing to a friend that Isaac has.

### [The Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands")

The Shifting Sands see Isaac as a dangerous bounty to be claimed. Isaac has single-handedly thwarted countless schemes of the bandit faction, and has thus earned much disdain from their ranks. His waning age has led some of the ruffians to believe he will finally be overcome by one of them soon.

### [Sloan](/wiki/Sloan "Sloan")

Isaac and Sloan develop a relationship based not on trust, but on a shared goal. Both men want to see Ellie safe from Silver’s curse, and are willing to march into danger together for that end. Isaac knows that Sloan is not being completely forthcoming, however, and keeps a close eye on him.

## Abilities and Powers

Isaac is a highly experienced combatant, thanks to his decades of work as a mercenary. He wields his trusty sword as if it were part of his own body, and knows just how to position himself to take full advantage of his plate mail. His years of fighting have taught him how to read opponents quickly and exploit even the smallest flaws in their techniques. Against a more skilled opponent, he’s even been known to fake a weakness of his own to bait a certain action which he can punish.

### Weapons

Isaac's main weapon is his sword. Made of exceptionally tough steel, his sword has weathered years of combat and slain countless beasts alongside Issac. While not as large as a two handed sword, Isaac's sword is still noticeably larger and heavier than an average sword, a trait no doubt necessary to be able to pierce and cut even the toughest of monsters. While the sword has suffered some deterioration due to the intensity of use and the multiple ferocious creatures of Elluryah, it has nonetheless remained as strong as its wielder.

### Physical Strength

Isaac's physical strength is evident by his tall and noticeably muscular frame. Maintaining his body through the use of his heavy sword and regularly fighting creatures much larger than himself, Isaac's physical strength can be equaled to that of several men, only falling behind the likes of [Garth](/wiki/Garth "Garth"), who is known as "The Strongest Man in the Kingdom". In Scars, he is shown to be able to hold back attacks from Silver, a Grand Demon almost universally feared throughout the land. His physique is strong, but not overly bulky, as he is shown to be just as agile as he is strong. He is capable of dodging attacks from creatures who are usually much faster than the average human.

### Fighting Ability

Isaac is an extremely seasoned warrior, veteran of many battles throughout his entire life. He has fought and slain creatures that most people, even magic users, would not dare cross. Isaac is a fairly analytical fighter, quickly deducing weak points or attack patterns from his foes, down to an almost instinct. While a very competent fighter, Isaac is not one to rush blindly into battle and in fact prefers to avoid fighting whenever possible. He can be known to turn down jobs if he assesses that the risk is higher than the reward. On occasion he has been known to refuse to engage in battle if he finds that his chances are too low. This is evident when he is cornered by some bandits using a dangerous creature to attack. Rather than engaging, he accepts handing over his weapons and armor, though threateningly declaring that he will retrieve his possessions later on.

## History

### [Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

In “A Terrible Fate” Isaac ultimately agrees to help Sloan by fighting the Grand Demon Silver. In “Aces and the Joker” Isaac and Sloan are interrupted by some Shifting Sands who have a grudge to settle with Isaac. The bandits have the upper hand due to some shady planning, so Isaac tells them to take what they want, but that he’ll find them later and make them regret it. Sloan freezes the bandits with his power, however, and the conflict is avoided. In “Darkness on the Horizon” Isaac and Sloan set out into Forsyth Forest to hunt Silver down. They discuss the psychic reading Ghenim did on Sloan, and Isaac reveals that he has a protection spell to keep him safe from Silver’s curse.

In “Vital Spirit” Isaac and Sloan continue their trek through the forest. Isaac tells of some of his many battles, showing off scars as he does. Silver works his way into the duo’s minds, so Sloan tells Isaac some of his happy memories as a distraction. In “Forest Folley” Isaac and Silver meet face to face. They trade threats before the fight begins. They seem evenly matched for a while, but Silver lands a powerful blow that knocks Isaac down and turns the tides. Silver considers waiting for Isaac’s protection spell to end, and then cursing him. Isaac calms himself, and focuses on the good that slaying Silver will do. As his fear and anger diminish, the fight changes course. Isaac manages to slice through one of Silver’s arms, dismembering him. Isaac steps in to swing the final blow, but finds himself frozen by Sloan’s magic. When he’s released, Silver is already dead. In “I Feel Asleep” Isaac finds Sloan and Ellie in a cabin, and learns the truth of Sloan’s plan. After the events play out, Isaac leaves gold and equipment behind for Ellie and her uncle, and heads back toward Bristol.

In “Hero’s Shade” Sloan thinks of all the mental scars he carries, though the track has no lyrics.

### [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

Isaac is mentioned briefly in “The Setting Obscene” when Garth tells Wade that it's said someone recently killed Silver the Grand Demon, but no one seems to know who was responsible for such a feat.
