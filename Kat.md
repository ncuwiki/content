## Appearance

Kat is a short dark-skinned girl with a thin frame. Her hair is a large afro that's a bit bigger than her head.

During the events of [Legend of the Light gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem") she wears her signature blue hood over a white dress and blue stockings that cover her entire legs. The dress is held by a blue belt, which also holds up two pocket flaps where she stores gems.

In [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane"), she switches to a loose fitting, slightly torn yellow dress over a blue shirt, held together by a dark blue sash, tied into a bow at the back. She keeps the blue stockings.

In [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm"), she returns to an outfit similar to the one worn in Legend of the Light Gem, but with a slightly more detailed design.

## Personality

[![[images/150px-KatJournalEntry1.jpg|Image]]](/wiki/File:KatJournalEntry1.jpg) An entry from Kat's Journal

Kat is an optimistic, innocent young girl. She always sees the good in people, often even where there might be none. She is kind, perhaps to a fault, always putting others before herself. This attitude has earned her the nickname **"Katrina the Kindhearted"**.

She is determined to prove that witches can be heroes, and wishes to change the people's perception of them by using her magic to help others. Kat is quick to try to befriend whoever she meets, which also seems to include any enemies that might cross their path, often to the dismay of Astrid. A pacifist at heart, she tries to avoid fighting whenever possible, instead opting to talk to people and gain their trust. This attitude can lead to enemies trying to take advantage of her or deceiving her, however Astrid is quick to step in to intervene.

As an infant, Kat was abandoned by her parents for being a witch, being raised by Phoebe during her early years and later adopted by [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael"). Because of her childhood, Kat treasures the idea of having a family, and believes to have found one in Ghael, [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid"). She sees Ghael as a mother and Astrid and Grub as her siblings. She holds great regard and admiration for her family.

## Relationships

### [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid")

Kat and Astrid consider themselves sisters, as they were both adopted by Ghael. They are also rivals, as Ghael has them spar with each other daily to hone and maintain their skills. Kat looks up to Astrid's combat skills and determination. At the same time, Kat's less focused attitude can frustrate Astrid, especially considering Kat is likely her equal or superior in battle. Despite their differences, the sisters always side with one another against any outside force. As a team, they have a firmly established synergy that make them very powerful.

When the relationship is strained, the rivalry can bring contention, but most of the time the sisters work brilliantly as a duo.

### [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael")

Ghael is Kat's adoptive mother and trainer. In both roles, Ghael is often more efficient than empathetic. Kat looks up to Ghael, and often brags about being her daughter. Ghael is interested in seeing Kat reach her potential, especially considering her unique abilities as a witch.

Ghael strenuously trains both Kat and Astrid to inherit her mantle of “strongest witch in the kingdom.” She provides a safe home and routine for the girls. She is very protective of them, but seldom provides much in the way of emotional support for them. The girls wish for a closer relationship with Ghael, but she often seems too preoccupied.

### [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub")

Grub is like a best friend to Kat, but also something of an uncle to the girls, since he spends as much time with Ghael as with them. When Kat was adopted into the household, Grub and Astrid grew apart, as Kat and Grub seem to have more in common. Grub loves to goof off, (often to [Ghael’s](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael") annoyance) which Kat finds hilarious.

### [Riza](/wiki/Riza "Riza")

Riza is something like Kat’s “cool aunt” who lets her stay up late and eat dessert for dinner. When dealing with Ghael, Riza is very professional, but when the girls visit she gives them the freedom she knows they lack at home.

### [Phoebe](/wiki/Phoebe "Phoebe")

Phoebe was Kat’s first mother figure, having raised the witch from an infant. Phoebe cared for and protected Kat for years, as she does all of her adopted children. Kat visits Phoebe and the young witches as frequently as she can. Phoebe is much more emotionally supportive for Kat than Ghael, although she can’t truly empathize.

### [The Novis](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis")

Kat, along with Astrid, Grub, and Riza working under Ghael, is determined to snuff out any remaining branches of The Novis. She wishes to apprehend and reform as many members as possible, and set them on a just, new path.

## Abilities and Powers

### Magic

Like all [witches](/wiki/Witch "Witch"), Kat can pull the energy out of elemental gems and use it to defend against that element, or to unleash offensive spells. What sets Kat apart is her ambidexterity, which enables her to pull from two stones at once, and release two spells at once. She can also use one for defense and one for offense. She can use any combination of elemental gems, which grants her the unique ability to produce spells of mixed elements. For example, she could create a torrent of mud by pumping out water from one hand and dirt from the other, mixing the blasts together.

Because of this, Kat is considered a prodigy among witches, which prompts [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael") to take her in as her pupil.

Because of her kind nature, Kat's attacks are often more on the defensive side. Her techniques usually involve deflecting attacks or subduing an enemy. This is further proved by the fact that she has never directly used a volt gem. She has only used volt gems to deter Astrid's electrical attacks, as wielding a certain elemental gem renders the user immune to said element's attacks.

Her spells are quite varied, quickly switching back and forth between gems as well as using her special ability to combine two elemental spells, creating entirely new ones in the process. For example, she is shown to use an earth gem and a water gem together, mixing the blasts to produce a flurry of mud. Even though she is a prodigy, Kat is still limited by being a relatively young witch. Kat is likely not strong enough to survive fully draining two gemstones in one blast, while Ghael has been known to pull three stones at once when in her prime.

## History

### Ch.1: [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")

[![[images/200px-AstridVS.png|Image]]](/wiki/File:AstridVS.png) Kat and Astrid sparring

In the opening track, “ [Which Witch Won](/wiki/Which_Witch_Won "Which Witch Won")” Kat and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid") begin their usual sparring session as they train under Ghael. The session ends in a draw as the two young witches are very evenly matched. In the next song “ [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem_(song) "Legend of the Light Gem (song)")” the girls' master [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael") recounts the titular legend, before instructing Kat, [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid"), and [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub") to venture to [Shinrin](/wiki/Shinrin "Shinrin") to investigate rumors of a light gem having been produced there. In “ [Another Adventure](/wiki/Another_Adventure "Another Adventure")” the gang ventures east through [Forsyth Forest](/wiki/Forsyth_Forest "Forsyth Forest") on their way to Shinrin. They joke around and grab little gifts for each other along the way. In “ [Silver the Sinister](/wiki/Silver_the_Sinister "Silver the Sinister")” as they camp for the night, Grub tells Kat and Astrid the legend of [Silver](/wiki/Silver "Silver"), a powerful [Grand Demon](/wiki/Grand_Demon "Grand Demon") that inhabits the woods. In “ [Discord Explored](/wiki/Discord_Explored "Discord Explored")” the gang investigates the rumors and conflicts of Shinrin, meeting the blacksmiths [Ulric](/wiki/Ulric "Ulric") and [Larv](/wiki/Larv "Larv"), who seem to have some conflict with one another.. They bring the two together to sort things out, but are quickly interrupted by the a group of bandits called [the Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands").

In “ [The Sandstorm Sudden](/wiki/The_Sandstorm_Sudden "The Sandstorm Sudden")” Kat, [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid"), and [Ulric](/wiki/Ulric "Ulric") fight [the Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands"), while Grub and Larv hide. This track reveals Kat’s ambidexterity for the first time, and reveals how it affects her magic. Once the scale tips in the trio’s favor, Ulric shouts at the bandits to leave town. In “ [A Confounding Find](/wiki/A_Confounding_Find "A Confounding Find")” Kat, Astrid, and Grub spend the night at Larv’s house. The girls spend some time jumping in leaves and chatting, while Grub talks with Larv. Kat feels that Larv is trustworthy. In “ [Rematch/Dispatch](/wiki/Rematch/Dispatch "Rematch/Dispatch")” Kat and Astrid fight Ulric and several Shifting Sands. The girls are shown to be a very formidable team, easily dispatching the various bandits. In “ [The King’s Right Hand](/wiki/The_King%27s_Right_Hand "The King's Right Hand")” Kat, Astrid, and Grub hand Ulric over to Garth and Wade, high ranking soldiers for the Kingdom of Elluryah.

In the closing track “ [Ghael the Grey](/wiki/Ghael_the_Grey "Ghael the Grey")” Kat, Grub, and Astrid recap the events in Shinrin to Ghael. The girls are followed home by the remaining Shifting Sands, looking to settle the score. This time however, they are faced with Ghael, who's name alone inspires fear into the bandits, who promptly run away. The girls are disappointed to be referred to as Ghael’s students during the confrontation.

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

The album opens with Kat and Astrid have another sparring session, in the aptly titled “ [Which Witch Two](/wiki/Which_Witch_Two "Which Witch Two")”. The fight ends when Astrid slaps Kat’s volt stone away, leaving her vulnerable and thus defeated. In “ [Til Stigmas Cease](/wiki/Til_Stigmas_Cease "Til Stigmas Cease")” Kat, Astrid, and Grub are tasked with tracking down and stopping a witch from [Boraea](/wiki/Boraea "Boraea") who has come to [Bristol](/wiki/Bristol "Bristol") to stir up trouble. In “ [Steadfast Outcast](/wiki/Steadfast_Outcast "Steadfast Outcast")” they manage to track down the suspect, a witch named [Nora](/wiki/Nora "Nora"), and end up fighting her after conversation fails to produce results. In “ [Chill for a Spell](/wiki/Chill_for_a_Spell "Chill for a Spell")” another witch, [Shina](/wiki/Shina "Shina"), enters the fight. The witches from the north end up winning the bout, largely due to Nora’s ability to cast ice spells without an elemental gem. In “ [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane_(Song) "Arcana Profane (Song)")” the girls tell Ghael of their loss and of Nora’s strange power. Ghael puts them through intense training while Riza tracks the rogue witches down once again.

In “ [Kat and Mouse](/wiki/Kat_and_Mouse "Kat and Mouse")” Kat and Astrid confront Nora and Shina once again. After a brief bout, Kat manages to talk Shina out of fighting, but Astrid and Nora refuse to end things peacefully. In “ [Mismatch/Impact](/wiki/Mismatch/Impact "Mismatch/Impact")” the unarmed Kat is targeted by Nora, but Grub intercepts the blast with his shield. Grub also blocks Kat from watching as Garth brutally injures Nora. In “ [At Sixes and Sevens](/wiki/At_Sixes_and_Sevens "At Sixes and Sevens")” Kat and Astrid are scolded by Ghael for their second failure against Nora and Shina. Kat feels awful when Astrid learns that Kat doesn’t try her hardest during their sparring. The closing track " [Peril Impending](/wiki/Peril_Impending "Peril Impending")" sets up the threat slowly creeping up on the land.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

The Storm begins with “ [Which Witch Three](/wiki/Which_Witch_Three "Which Witch Three")” in which Kat and Astrid spar more ferociously than ever before. Astrid pushes Kat to go as hard as she can, and this ultimately leads to Grub having to stop the fight. In “ [The Calm Before](/wiki/The_Calm_Before "The Calm Before")” Kat, Astrid, and Grub are instructed by Ghael to ambush a cult base, which is likely the Novis. It’s obvious that this mission is not to be taken lightly. Then, in “What Kat Dragged In-” Kat recalls a time when Astrid comforted her in the face of discrimination against witches. She doubts Astrid would respond positively to a similar situation anymore.

In “ [Dark Clouds Converge](/wiki/Dark_Clouds_Converge "Dark Clouds Converge")” Kat and Astrid fight a dozen Novis cultists, who quickly demonstrate their unnatural powers. Kat does her best to avoid casualties in the fight, but Astrid seems to be on a rampage. The witches manage to dispatch all of their foes. In “-What Kat Dragged In-” Kat looks around at the possibly-deceased bodies of the cultists. She remembers a fight with Astrid about sparing criminals, and laments that her sister and teacher don’t seem to mind death. In “ [The Storm)](/wiki/The_Storm_(song) "The Storm (song)")” Kat, Astrid, and Grub continue to fight [White Robe](/wiki/White_Robe "White Robe"). Astrid tosses Kat a volt gem and says that if they both blast him at the same time they can take him out. The cultist manages to knock Grub unconscious, leaving the witches in a desperate situation. Kat, however, is unable to fire the volt gem, having never used one on anyone due to their inherent lethality. Astrid, left with no choice, drains two volt gems at once to defeat White Robe, but her heart stops in the process. In “ [Lightning Strikes Twice](/wiki/Lightning_Strikes_Twice "Lightning Strikes Twice")” Kat goes even deeper into shock, after witnessing Astrid’s actions. Grub wakes up, and tells Kat to use the volt gem on Astrid. Kat collects herself and fires a volt gem at someone for the first time, and manages to restart Astrid’s heart and save her life.

Kat recalls more memories in “-What Kat Dragged In.” She remembers meeting Grub, Astrid, and Ghael for the first time. She fondly recalls the early days of their relationships, and laments the fractures that exist now. Finally in “ [A Glimmer in the Gloom](/wiki/A_Glimmer_in_the_Gloom "A Glimmer in the Gloom")” Kat feels guilty about how things played out against White Robe. Grub cheers her up, but she wishes Ghael would show some warmth as well. She pleads for a sign that things will be okay.
