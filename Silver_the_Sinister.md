| The sun finds its destination before the group finds theirs<br>They set up camp for the night and postpone their affairs<br>The girls’ flame gems spark a campfire-<br>Their water gems stave away thirst<br>They’ll rest but Grub decides it’s time to tell a scary story first<br>“So girls, do you recall the legend of Silver?<br>The demon known as Silver- evil in breathing form<br>Our anguish keeps it fed; our hatred keeps it warm<br>It curses us to die slow, and feeds on our despair<br>It lusts to be stronger and in our pain we take it there<br>“The scariest part of all, you may have already guessed<br>Silver stays right here in Forsyth Forest!”<br>As Grub’s story crescendos, he darts off into the shadows<br>Not for dramatic effect, rather his tightening neck<br>A poorly timed gemstone suddenly makes its presence known<br>He heaves, adds to his supply- darts back with a<br>“Now where was I?<br>Oh yeah, we’re all gonna die!<br>“Pawns pursue the grand soul<br>Those desperate or heedless<br>Die needlessly, it’s grievous”<br>Kat can’t help but intervene<br>“I bet Ghael could beat that thing!<br>She can blast three entire stones<br>At him at once- he’d be gone!<br>“The match would go without a hitch<br>Can’t beat the world’s strongest witch!”<br>“As long as Silver didn’t get into her head” Grub agrees<br>“Ghael would come out on top- the demon would be dead<br>The grand soul would grant an extra chance at life<br>A great prize but it’s an all-or-nothing fight”<br>Astrid declares “someday, I’ll blow Silver away”<br>Grub adds “okay, but let’s say, that’s a few decades away<br>Silver’s terrain is the only place where he’ll attack<br>Best to just stay away, in fact<br>The only reason that we had to camp out overnight<br>Is because we took the long way to avoid that very fight” |
