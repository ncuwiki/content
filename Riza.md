# Riza

Riza is a rogue who lives in Bristol, and patrols its dark streets. She is a fairly mysterious figure, and this is not by coincidence.

The impact she’s made on Bristol in her thirty-something years of life will likely never be figured up, but it is certainly greater than almost anyone realizes.

## Appearance

## Personality

## Relationships

### Ghael

Riza and Ghael are allies in protecting Elluryah. Riza patrols Bristol’s dark streets and reports big threats back to Ghael. While their relationship is mostly professional, they share dinner on occasion, and Riza often has Kat and Astrid over.

Using her skills of stealth and cunning, she deals with many threats on her own. If she uncovers something out of her league, however, she informs Ghael, who decides how to proceed.

### [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid")

Riza is something like Kat and Astrid’s “cool aunt” who lets them stay up late and eat dessert for dinner. When dealing with Ghael, Riza is very professional, but when the girls visit she gives them the freedom she knows they lack at home. Astrid often asks Riza to train her in hand-to-hand combat and other rogue abilities, which Riza is happy to do.

## Abilities and Powers

A particularly skilled rouge, Riza’s stealth skills let her move around quickly and undetected. She is also very perceptive, constantly checking for distant sounds or minute visual cues. She is highly evasive and coordinated in hand-to-hand combat. Her alliance with Ghael and her students also offer her additional weight to throw around.

## History

### Ch.1: [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem")
