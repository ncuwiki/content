### [Ch. 6 - The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “Black as Thunder” White Robe confronts Kat, Astrid, Grub, and Garth as they are attacking his base of operations. Over the bodies of a dozen of his fallen allies, he casually invites the intruders to attack him. Garth promptly accepts, but White Robe gingerly catches a full swing of his hammer. Garth manages to surprise his opponent and break several ribs with his sole clean strike of the encounter. White Robe then unveils his “big boy attack,” in which he launches an unseen blast of energy at Garth from twenty feet away, which knocks the soldier unconscious.

In “The Storm” Astrid attacks White Robe, draining an entire volt gem with one might spell. White Robe withstands the blast, showing no sign of damage whatsoever, and then uppercuts Astrid into the ceiling with superhuman force. Kat and Grub launch attacks of their own, with Grub managing to catch White Robe off guard and cause some notable damage. Grub is subsequently knocked across the room, and goes unconscious. After failing to convince Kat to help her kill White Robe, Astrid drains two entire volt gems herself to produce a single immense blast. She and White Robe are both electrocuted, and both of their hearts stop.
