Elemental gems are produced and heaved up sporadically by [kobolds](/wiki/Kobold "Kobold"), who often then sell them at a high price.
Though mainly used by [witches](/wiki/Witch "Witch"), elemental gems fetch a high price due to their brilliant colors, which appear to swirl about beneath the outer surface. Earth gems tend to be the cheapest, as they aren’t as visually brilliant as the others.

[Witches](/wiki/Witch "Witch") can pull the energy from elemental gems for offensive and defensive magic. Pulling the energy from these gems in other ways is very difficult, but it has been done in rare instances. Arden’s armor has earth gems socketed into it, and spending their energy can conjure stones at his will. This is the only known extant example, although the royal family is researching other potential uses. When all of the energy is exhausted from an elemental gem, it becomes a dull grey, and is inert.

There is a fabled sixth type of elemental gem - the light gem. Information about this stone is introduced in the titular track from “ [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem").” According to the fable, a kobold who is pure of heart may produce light gems, which can then be wielded by a witch who is also pure of heart. The legend also mentions the light gem being used to create a bright blade.

Chapter one of the NCU revolves around [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat"), [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub"), and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid") venturing to [Shinrin](/wiki/Shinrin "Shinrin") to investigate rumors that a kobold named [Larv](/wiki/Larv "Larv") has produced a light gem.
