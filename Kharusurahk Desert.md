## Geography

The desert makes up most of the southern region of Elluryah, reaching all the way to the coast.
In contrast to the densely green Forsyth Forest up north, not much plant life, or any life, survives the harsh heat of the desert. Journeying through the desert is a grueling task.

## Demographics

The town of Eredet is built around a series of mines, deep in the desert.

[The Shifting Sands](/wiki/The_Shifting_Sands "The Shifting Sands") gang is based somewhere in the Kharusurahk Desert, and know the sandy lands better than anyone else.

## History

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")

Tracks 3-7 of Something Fierce (Chapter 7) take place in the Kharusurahk Desert.

## Trivia

• The word “Kharusurahk” is a palindrome- it’s the same forward and backward. This represents how one might get lost and end up back where they started.
