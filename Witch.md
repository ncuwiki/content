## Description\[ [edit](/wiki/Witch?action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description") \| [hide](/wiki/Witch "Expand or collapse this section") \| [hide all](/wiki/Witch "Expand or collapse all sections on this page")\]

The word witches refers specifically to women born with magical ability, who are able to pull energy out of elemental gems and release it, usually in an offensive or defensive spell.

Witches can be easily identified by their unusually colored eyes, which tend to be purple, red, pink, yellow, or orange.

A witch holds a gem in her nondominant hand, pulls its energy into her core, and then can release the energy from her dominant hand. While a witch is holding elemental energy within her core, she has great resistance to that energy type. For example, a witch wielding a volt gem is highly resistant to electric shock, and can displace bolts of electricity at will. Energy can only be stored in this way while physically holding the stone, however. The witche's elemental resistance will also disappear after releasing the energy.

Experienced witches are able to pull energy from multiple matching stones at a time. Ghael can completely drain three stones instantly, releasing an immense amount of energy. Attempting to pull energy from two different stones at once causes severe pain in a witch, and does not result in any spell. Kat is an exception, as she is biologically ambidextrous. She is able to pull energy from both hands, and also release energy from both hands. She can also hold two types of energy in her core at once.

## History\[ [edit](/wiki/Witch?action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History") \| [hide](/wiki/Witch "Expand or collapse this section")\]

The general population tends to be wary of witches, due to their unnatural and highly dangerous powers. Historically, many witches have used their powers for personal gain at the expense of others, although the most powerful and famous witch in history, Ghael, actually helped save Elluryah during the cult attack.
