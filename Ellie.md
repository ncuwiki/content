### [Sloan](/wiki/Sloan "Sloan")

## History

### Ch.3: [Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

In “A Terrible Fate” Sloan reveals that he and his daughter have received Grand Demon Silver’s curse, and will perish in seven days. Isaac agrees to help them.

In “Darkness on the Horizon” Sloan says Ellie is staying with her uncle for now, and reveals that he and Ellie had been in Shinrin looking for Collette, Ellie’s mother.

In “I Feel Asleep” Isaac finds Sloan in a cabin, removing Ellie from the case he had been carrying since they first met. She had been frozen in time by Sloan’s magic, and thus hadn’t experienced any of the grim mission herself. She had been holding a knife when frozen, and Sloan used her and the knife to slay Silver just before Isaac had a chance to. This transitioned the Grand Soul into Ellie, meaning that she would be returned to life after perishing from Silver’s curse. Isaac accepts this, leaving gifts as Sloan passes away. Ellie’s uncle approaches the cabin to adopt her, clearly having been instructed to do so ahead of time by Sloan.
