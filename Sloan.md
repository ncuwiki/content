### [Ellie](/wiki/Ellie "Ellie")

Sloan would do anything for his daughter. After accidentally bringing her face-to-face with Grand Demon Silver, he uses every resource at his disposal to come up with a way to save her. His wife Colette has been missing for years, so he is Ellie’s sole caretaker.

### [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac "Isaac")

Sloan and Isaac develop a relationship based not on trust, but on a shared goal. Both men want to see Ellie safe from Silver’s curse, and are willing to march into danger together for that end. Isaac knows that Sloan is not being completely forthcoming, however, and keeps a close eye on him.

## Abilities and Powers

### Magic Ability

Sloan was born with the ability to cast a single powerful spell: he can freeze targets in time. His targets become stuck in a single position, but remain able to be moved to different locations. They perceive nothing while under his spell, and remember nothing of the time they were frozen. Sloan can affect multiple targets with his spell, but his limit will be reached sooner this way. His power being inborn, however, means his limit is considerably high.

## History

### Ch.3: [Scars](/wiki/Scars "Scars")

In “A Terrible Fate” Sloan desperately tries to hire a powerful fighter to kill the Grand Demon Silver, after he and his daughter received the demon’s curse. Many turn him down, including Garth, before Isaac finally agrees.

In “Aces and the Joker” Sloan and Isaac are interrupted by some Shifting Sands who have a grudge to settle with Isaac. The bandits have the upper hand due to some shady planning, so Isaac tells them to take what they want, but that he’ll find them later and make them regret it. Sloan freezes the bandits with his power, however, and the conflict is avoided.

In “Star Matrix View” Great Mage Ghenim performs a psychic reading on Sloan.

In “Darkness on the Horizon” Sloan and Isaac set out into Forsyth Forest to hunt Silver down. They discuss the psychic reading Ghenim did on Sloan. It is mentioned that Sloan isn’t being completely forthcoming, yet Isaac doesn’t believe him to be malicious in any way.

In “Vital Spirit” Sloan and Isaac continue their trek through the forest. Silver works his way into the duo’s minds, so Sloan tells Isaac some of his happy memories as a distraction.

In “Forest Folley” Sloan meets Silver again, with Isaac present this time. Sloan feigns passing out, but watches as Isaac manages to gain the upper hand. Just before the final blow is dealt, Sloan freezes them both with his magic. He enacts the penultimate part of his plan and then flees, releasing his spell on Isaac and the deceased Silver.

In “I Feel Asleep” Sloan releases his spell from Ellie, in the safety of a nearby cabin. She had been in his large backpack the whole time, frozen by his magic. He had used a dagger in her hand to deal the fatal blow to Silver, which transferred the Grand Soul into her. He explains to her that she will still have to endure his curse, but that she will be okay afterwards. The two lie down, and hold one another. Sloan succumbs to Silver’s curse, and passes away with a smile on his face. Isaac, having seen all of this, leaves Sloan’s money and some extra gear for Sloan’s brother, who approaches the cabin to take custody of Ellie.
