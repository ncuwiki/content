## Trivia

- Musically, Something Fierce is the heaviest NCU release, with an abrasive mix, frequent blast beats, and glitchy effects throughout.

- The title “Ransack/Payback” references previous NCU song titles “ [Mismatch/Impact](/wiki/Mismatch/Impact "Mismatch/Impact")” and “ [Rematch/Dispatch](/wiki/Rematch/Dispatch "Rematch/Dispatch").”

- The title “ [Just Deserts](/wiki/Just_Deserts "Just Deserts")” refers to how the idiom directly relates to the events depicted in the song, but also to how most of chapter 7 takes place in a vast desert.

- The album art was created by Alicaido.
