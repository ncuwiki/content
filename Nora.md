## History

### Ch.4: [Arcana Profane](/wiki/Arcana_Profane "Arcana Profane")

In “Til Stigmas Cease” Ghael tells Kat, Grub, and Astrid of a witch that has travelled to Bristol from Boraea to cause trouble. Ghael is referring to Nora, and she doesn’t yet know that Nora has an apprentice.

In “Steadfast Outcast” Kat, Astrid, and Grub find Nora in her hideout. Kat tries to avoid a fight, but Nora initiates one anyway. After a bit of back-and-forth Kat tries again to talk Nora down, but it is unsuccessful. Shina shows up and joins the fight.

In “Chill for a Spell” Nora continues to fight Astrid. The fight is mostly evenly matched, until Astrid manages to kick Nora’s stone out of her hand. Rather than Astrid taking the upper hand, this results in Nora launching a surprise attack, which reveals her ability to cast ice spells without a stone. Astrid’s legs are cut by icicle shards, and then she is pinned under snow. Nora attempts to tempt Astrid and Kat with more power, and then exits.

In “Arcana Profane” Kat and Astrid tell Ghael about Nora’s powers, which even Ghael cannot explain. Ghael says Kat will fight Nora when they next meet.

In “Kat and Mouse” the four witches meet for a rematch. Nora and Astrid both disregard Kat’s pleas to avoid violence, and a fight erupts. Kat manages to talk Shina out of continuing to fight, just before Garth arrives.

In “Mismatch Impact” Nora decides to flee, but doesn’t have an easy path to take. She launches a barrage of ice at Kat as a distraction, which Grub manages to block with his shield. She then attacks Wade when he refuses to let her escape. He shoots an arrow into her thigh as she blasts him with icicle shards. They both fall. Garth commands Astrid to get out of his way, and crushes Nora’s other leg under his hammer. He raises his hammer again to finish her off, but Wade asks him to stop. Nora tells Astrid, Kat, and Grub that they aided in her goal.

Nora isn’t mentioned again in Arcana Profane, but it can be inferred that she and Shina are sent to the dungeon to serve out sentences for their crimes.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “The Calm Before” Ghael reveals that Nora and Shina had been hired as a distraction to her and the rest of Bristol. Their actions damaged public opinion of witches, as intended.
