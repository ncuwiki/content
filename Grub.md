## Appearance

Grub is a slender [kobold](/wiki/Kobold "Kobold") of average height for his species and purple skin. Like most kobolds, he stands at around roughly 4 feet, with a slight hunched posture common in kobolds.

He is almost always seen wearing an old chestplate over a cloth shirt.

## Personality

Grub has a carefree, humorous personality. He can usually be heard spouting a witty remark at Ghael.

His jokey attitude is somewhat a cover for a persistent for the safety and wellbeing of his loved ones. His upbeat personality is somewhat meant to counteract the stern teaching methods of Ghael. Grub is very much aware of the dangers the girls encounter as witches, as well as his inherent physical weakness and inability to protect them should the need arise.

He resigns himself to merely doing his best to ensure the girls become strong warriors, without sacrificing their youth and innocence. He tries hard to maintain a sense of morality for the girls. While this is almost effortless with the pure-hearted Kat, he has a harder time maintaining a sense of restraint in the battle-hungry Astrid.

## Relationships

### [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael")

Grub serves as Ghael's underling, which means he tends to most errands and tasks that Ghael is either too old to do or asks him to do. Together, they are allies in protecting [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"). Their friendship goes back many years, even though to an outsider it may seem that Grub is a nuisance to Ghael. Grub has known Ghael since he was very young and feels a deep respect and devotion to his master. Despite being an underling, Grub addresses Ghael in a very casual manner, more akin to a son talking to his elderly mother. While Ghael tends to treat him rather roughly, she is shown to care and respect him, even referring to him as "old friend". Grub takes care of the day to day errands of the house, including shopping for supplies, cleaning the house and taking care of Astrid and Kat.

Ghael trusts Grub fully, despite his goofy nature.

### [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid")

Grub serves as caretaker for both Kat and Astrid, providing a more delicate and tender approach to the girls than Ghael. When she first came under the tutelage of Ghael, Astrid immediately connected with the fun-loving Grub. He made sure to play with her and maintain a healthy environment for the young girl as best as he could. As Astrid grew older and more focused on her training, the relationship between them became more distant. As she became more serious and less likely to indulge in mindless fun, the connection they shared started to strain. Grub now struggles to find ways to communicate with the fun loving young girl he helped raise, instead on occasion clashing with the battle-oriented woman she is becoming.

Because she was adopted by Ghael, Astrid did not have an actual birthdate. In an attempt to remedy this, Grub gave Astrid a yellow scarf as a birthday gift, declaring that day would be her birthday from now on. This scarf became a signature for Astrid, who almost always wears it. Astrid claims she wears the scarf purely for convenience, but deep down it still holds a certain emotional comfort for her.

### [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat")

When Kat came under the tutelage of Ghael, Grub had already spent several years raising Astrid and was thus a bit more confident in interacting with a young witch. Kat's kind and loving attitude matched well with Grub's own carefree nature and the two became close friends. However, due to having to split his attention between both Astrid and Kat, the relationship between Grub and Kat is not as tight-knit as it was with Astrid. Despite this, Grub and Kat regularly indulge in fun shenanigans, to the annoyance of both Ghael and Astrid. Grub cherishes Kat's optimistic and kind outlook on life, seeing in her a genuine desire to do good in a world that so often wants the opposite.

Grub is rather protective of Kat's innocence, perhaps in an attempt to prevent her becoming as cynical as Astrid has. He makes an effort to make sure Ghael is not so stern to the girls, particularly Kat. He tries to make sure the girls remember that they are people first, and warriors second. Due to being adopted by Ghael from a young age, Kat did not have an actual birthdate. Like he had done with Astrid several years ago, Grub gifted Kat a blue hooded cape, declaring they would celebrate her birthday on this date from now on. Kat makes sure to wear the hood whenever they go out and is very careful to keep it clean and undamaged, being one of her most prized possessions.

Grub vows to protect Kat and Astrid when the three go on missions for Ghael, even though they are clearly much more powerful than he is. Kat and Grub have very similar moral compasses. Grub also cuts up with the girls, often to Ghael’s annoyance.

### [Ghenim](/wiki/Ghenim "Ghenim")

Grub and Ghenim are allies in protecting [Elluryah](/wiki/Elluryah "Elluryah"). Although the kobold can’t do much in the way of physical combat, his kinship with Ghael and the Great Mage make him a valuable partner.

### [The Novis](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis")

Grub is determined to snuff out any remaining branches of The Novis. He joins Kat and Astrid on their missions to battle with the cult, providing backup any way he can. He also meets with Ghael and Ghenim to discuss the state of things and make plans to move forward.

## Abilities and Powers

### Agility

Although his combat prowess is lacking, Grub is quite nimble, as most [kobolds](/wiki/Kobold "Kobold") are. His slender kobold physique gives him a relatively agile movement speed, at the cost of not having much physical strength, even for a kobold.

Due to his low physical strength, Grub almost exclusively relies on evasive maneuvers in battle, quickly dodging oncoming attacks or jumping out of harm's way. He usually serves as a distraction for foes while [Kat](/wiki/Kat "Kat") and [Astrid](/wiki/Astrid "Astrid") attack.

He can also be rather cunning, and thinks quickly on his feet.

### Weapons & Armor

Grub is seldom seen without his trademark armor: an old chestplate over a cloth shirt. The chestplate, which was not designed for kobold physique, covers a large portion of his body due to his short stature. The armor also possesses two large shoulder plates, which help shield him from physical attacks that would normally prove seriously damaging to his body.

Grub also carries around an old round shield, made of wood and steel, usually used to train younglings in sparring. While meant for low impact training, the shield has nonetheless withstood various attacks in battle, on some occasions even being enough to resist ice barrages and arrow hits. Despite its low damage threshold, Grub has grown relatively capable of defensive maneuvers with his shield, at times deflecting enemy attacks that the girls could not counter in time.

His signature weapon is a small wooden sparring sword. Much to his dismay, [Ghael](/wiki/Ghael "Ghael") prohibits Grub from using a real sword, as she believes he will easily gore himself by accident. The sword, more accurately described as a relatively sword shaped piece of wood, would easily break if clashed against a real sword. Grub usually relies on whacking enemies with it or used as a way of keeping smaller beasts at bay.
