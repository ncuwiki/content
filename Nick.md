# Nick

Nick is a Mage who lives in the snowy town of Boraea. More of a scholar than an actual magic user, Nick has spent much of his reclusive life isolated and studying leylines and the different effects of magic. Despite being highly knowledgeable, his ability to actually cast magic is weak. Something from his past seems to constantly linger in the back of his mind.

### [The Novis](/wiki/The_Novis "The Novis")

Twenty years ago Nick was a member of The Novis. He regrets his actions in the cult to the point that he quarantines himself in Boraea for two decades. A mysterious pulling in the back of his mind finally draws him back to Bristol, however, and it seems the mage and the cult aren’t done with each other just yet.

## History

### Ch.2: [Twenty Years of Snow](/wiki/Twenty_Years_of_Snow "Twenty Years of Snow")

In “Dreaming” Nick is haunted by some unknown trauma, presented through dramatic and mysterious imagery. In “Twenty Years of Snow” it is revealed that Nick hasn’t ventured outside of the snowy town of Boraea for two decades. In “Boraea” Nick is revealed to be a recluse, bordering on agoraphobia. The other residents of Boraea still view him as a stranger after many years, and are likely suspicious of him.

In “Aetheric Sanctuary” Nick continues to study magic and leylines, but no notable progress is made. In “Leaving” Nick gives in to a beckoning in his mind, and sets out to leave Boraea for the first time in decades. The trauma introduced early in the album is elaborated on, as it is revealed that Nick has caused death and fled at some point in his past.

### Ch.5: [Silver and White](/wiki/Silver_and_White "Silver and White")

In “Silver Web (Leylines III)” Nick treks south across the Mistral Mountains, from Boraea to Bristol. He follows a mysterious calling, fearing that the past he escaped twenty years ago may be resurfacing.In “Bristol” Nick wanders the streets of the capital city. He can’t help but recall things from his past which disturb him greatly. After many nights of this, three men accost Nick. In “The Mage” Nick is brought by the men to a Novis hideout, where the titular mage reveals that he knows exactly who Nick is. Though he attempts to deny it, it is revealed that Nick was part of the Novis twenty years ago. The mage explains that the Novis is nearly fully prepared for a mass attack, and that Nick will be rewarded with the powers he seeks if he’ll join them.

In “Resolve; Fate” Nick ultimately refuses the mage’s offer, after remembering the horrors he helped to bring about decades ago. The mage tells Nick he’ll have to be killed. Nick raises his hand at the mage, in a last ditch effort to find his magical powers. In “Silver and White (Leylines IV)” the narrative becomes fairly abstract, but it seems that the pressure of Nick’s situation awakens something within him.

### Ch.6: [The Storm](/wiki/The_Storm "The Storm")

In “ [The Setting Obscene](/wiki/The_Setting_Obscene "The Setting Obscene")” Garth includes “a mage from up north” in a list of shady figures that have shown up in Bristol recently.

### Ch.7: [Something Fierce](/wiki/Something_Fierce "Something Fierce")

In “Plight of the Knights” Garth mentions that “a shady mage from the north” is in custody, and speculates that Nick conspired with [Nora](/wiki/Nora "Nora") and [Shina](/wiki/Shina "Shina").
