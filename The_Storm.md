## Trivia

- Musically, The Storm is similar to Uhole’s previous NCU full-lengths, but with a darker and more frantic tone.

- The album art was created by Pat Garland, who goes by Fault.

- “ [Which Witch Three](/wiki/Which_Witch_Three "Which Witch Three")” is a reference to “ [Which Witch Won](/wiki/Which_Witch_Won "Which Witch Won")?” and “ [Which Witch Two](/wiki/Which_Witch_Two "Which Witch Two")” from the first two albums of Uhole’s NCU full-length trilogy.

The “What Kat Dragged In” tracks act as a refrain for the album as a whole, the way a chorus would for a song. A version with all three tracks combined can be found on Uhole’s Soundcloud.
