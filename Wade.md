### Garth

Wade is an expert marksman. He covers Garth’s issues with mobility and range by offering both in spades. With his longbow, he can pinpoint a shot on a moving target quite a distance away. As the second-in-command of the Royal Army, he also wields considerable political power.

Being Garth's second in command, the two soldier work excellently as a team, complimenting each other's fighting styles and personalities. While Garth is extremely strong and durable, Wade’s speed and finesse provides an ideal complement to the hulking soldier. Similarly, Garth is a powerful speaker, but lacks Wade’s eloquence and wit. Though unspoken, Wade also provides the compassion for others that Garth often lacks.
