## Trivia

- Musically, the album is similar to [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem"), but features one full hip hop track.

- “Which Witch Two” is a reference to “ [Which Witch Won](/wiki/Which_Witch_Won "Which Witch Won")?” from [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem"), effectively making it _**"Which Witch One".**_

- The title “ [Mismatch/Impact](/wiki/Mismatch/Impact "Mismatch/Impact")” references the respective (eighth) track of [Legend of the Light Gem](/wiki/Legend_of_the_Light_Gem "Legend of the Light Gem"), which is called “Rematch / Dispatch.”

- “At Sixes and Sevens” is the name of [Unicorn Hole](/wiki/Unicorn_Hole "Unicorn Hole")’s previous band. Many musical ideas from that band (which were never recorded) were used for Uhole’s NCU full-length trilogy, including all of the music for this track - save for the synths.
